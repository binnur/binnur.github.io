Technology is inherently difficult to manage with its ever changing and
unpredictable nature. These pages capture my thoughts on technology as change:
its creation, application, dissemination and impact with emphasis on human
values.

My background is in Management of Technology and my passion is shaping
technologies into great products. I recently started to study philosophy of
technology for insights on challenges of directing and shaping our technology
creations: from definition to design and evolution.
