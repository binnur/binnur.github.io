# Binnur Al-Kazily

As a technology product manager, I enjoy exploring topics involving technology
management and high-tech product development. My interests also include
design, culture, complex systems, startups and more. I enjoy solving complex
problems and taking on new challenges.

My background is in Management of Technology and my passion is shaping technologies into great products. I am a life-long learner, who has been through several technology life-cycles. I know it is not just about the technology, but delivering value to the customer and the business. With that, I am thriving for an interdisciplinary approach to see how we can redefine, reshape and rebuild our existing frameworks for technology management and high-tech product development to champion human values. For more information, please read “Decomposing technology’s relationship with society“.

Originally from Turkey, I am an avid traveler and enjoy working globally, across cultures.
