As a technology product manager, I enjoy exploring topics involving technology
management and high-tech product development. However, my interests also include
design, culture, complex systems, sustainability and Zen Buddhist teachings. I
enjoy solving complex problems and working on challenges that stretch my
abilities.

Welcome!
Technology is inherently difficult to manage with its ever changing and unpredictable nature. These pages capture my thoughts on technology as change: its creation, application, dissemination and impact with emphasis on human values.

My background is in Management of Technology and my passion is shaping
technologies into great products. I recently started to study philosophy of
technology for insights on challenges of directing and shaping our technology
creations: from definition to design and evolution.

I am a life-long learner, who has been through several technology life-cycles. I know it is not just about the technology, but delivering value to the customer and the business. With that, I am thriving for an interdisciplinary approach to see how we can redefine, reshape and rebuild our existing frameworks for technology management and high-tech product development to champion human values. For more information, please read “Decomposing technology’s relationship with society“.

Originally from Turkey, I am an avid traveler and enjoy working globally, across cultures.
